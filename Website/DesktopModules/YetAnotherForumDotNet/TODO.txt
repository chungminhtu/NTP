- Approved users don't have to be moderated

- Add message / header specific to groups or topics. e.g.: display 
  a message to all Guests encouraging them to register on the site.

- Tooltips for user profile links (View profile).

- Show that there are messages to be moderated.

- Keep deleted posts for later purge. Option for moderators to tell why the post was deleted.

- Improve admin user editor: user stats, edit profile, edit password, edit banned/suspended status,
  and view IP access history.

- Limit sigs to 5 lines or X characters. (Configurable in the backend.)

- Link correctly back to forum from install.
